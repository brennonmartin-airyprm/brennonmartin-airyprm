## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Back during the Covid shutdown, I built a bare bones CRM for my personal use on the Bubble no-code platform to support my networking actvities. Spreadsheets just weren't cutting it anymore. Now I'm going to see if I can figure out how to rebuilt it with actual code using an AI assistant. I'm a product manager, not a developer, so this should be an interesting experiment.

Wish me luck!
